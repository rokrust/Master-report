This section presents the results of running the system described in section \ref{sec:implementation}, with the goal of investigating performance of the EKF with real, raw data. The results are compared with a post-processed RTK solution from RTKLIB for reference.\\

\section{Performing the tests}
To compare the MEKF with other systems several tests were devised, keeping in mind known limitations of each of the systems.

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l||p{5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Tested systems} & \textbf{Test description} & \textbf{Expected result}\\
        \hline
        Coupled/uncoupled & Circular pattern & The MEKF should show an increase in precision compared to the     single GNSS solution.\\
        \hline
        Indirect/direct filter &  Highly dynamic zigzag motion & The MEKF should follow the quickly changing     state better than the direct filter.\\
        \hline
        The full system & Straight line motion/square pattern & The MEKF should generally perform better than     the other systems\\
