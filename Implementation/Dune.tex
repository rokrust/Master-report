\subsection{RTKLIB interface}
    %Based on the rtkrcv commandline program from rtklib
    %Handles rtklib config and cmd files
    %Can play back log files as mentioned in section \ref{sec:imp:simulators}
    %

\subsection{Extended Kalman filter}
    %As described in section \ref{sec:imp:kalman}
    %PV estimation
    %Doppler, pseudorange
    %Describe tuning process (playback imc log?)
